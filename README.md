It can visualize three classic synchronization problems:  🧑‍🏭 Producer–Consumer (bounded buffer problem)  💈 Sleeping Barber (customer–barber queue synchronization)  🍽️ Dining Philosophers (deadlock and resource sharing)


Each simulation:
Uses threads + semaphores/locks to simulate concurrent behavior.
Dynamically updates a canvas to visualize entity states.
Displays live status logs in a scrollable text box.
Has speed, count, and resource controls for flexibility.



✅ Features included:
Multi-threaded simulation (runs in real-time).
Adjustable speed via slider.
Color-coded legend for clear visualization.
Works as a standalone .py GUI app.
